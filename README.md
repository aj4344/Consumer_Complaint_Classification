# Consumer-Complaint-Classification

- **Problem:** Each week the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sends thousands of consumerâ€™s complaints about financial product and services to one of our client for a response. 
- **Solution:** we had delivered a generalized multiclass classification ML model more focused on Logistic Regression and Linear SVM, Feature Engineering using NLP to convert textual data to numeric so machine can understand where TF_IDF is the most generic one to do Feature extraction in the form of numeric data. 
- Once the algorithm is in place, whenever there is new complaint, we can easily categorize it and can be redirected to the concerned person.
